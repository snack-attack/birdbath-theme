            <h6>The Bath Institute for Rheumatic Diseases (BIRD) exists to support arthritis research, education and patient engagement so that we can improve treatment for patients with rheumatic diseases.</h6>
            <p class="pr-5">Bath has always been at the forefront of bone and joint disease research, education and patient care, as part of its history as a city with thermal waters since at least Roman times, and with one of the first national specialist hospitals in the country founded in 1738.</p>
            <p class="pr-5">BIRD was formed in 1975 by the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases (known affectionately as ‘the Min’ and now part of the Royal United Hospital, Bath) and the University of Bath.  Although we became an independent charity in 1981, we collaborate closely with both organisations, because bringing clinicians and scientists together is at the heart of what we do.</p>
